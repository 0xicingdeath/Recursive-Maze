#Recursive-Maze

I had just learnt recursion, and was extremely confused about how to implement it - and this program was me playing around with 
making a maze, and then recursively finding the solution (as opposed to using a loop). 

At the time, recursion was extremely confusing, and I was having a lot of trouble understanding why one wouldn't use a loop instead.
